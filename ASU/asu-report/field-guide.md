# Field Guide

We will provide a general overview of how to deploy and maintain the ASU 2 in the field. For in depth documentation refer to the full user guide: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JrXlkBNLy5zbhXjEVzXjsKxHEMzv7dOoig-mSg38msU/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JrXlkBNLy5zbhXjEVzXjsKxHEMzv7dOoig-mSg38msU/edit?tab=t.0)

## Initial Setup (tree mounting method)

To deploy the ASU 2 in the field the user will need the ASU device, battery, mounting plate, ratchets, USB drive, and solar panel. The USB drive should be pre-loaded with the desired recording schedule.

The user will mount the equipment to a large tree via the cloth ratchets, with the ASU2 facing north to be shaded as much as possible and the solar panel/battery mounted to the same tree but facing south. Connect 3 sets of wires as per the guide (connection points are set up such that they cannot be connected incorrectly).

Whenever possible avoid exposing the ASU2 device to high temperatures, if possible mount it to a north facing side of a tree. The solar panel and battery can be exposed to heat and sun without any negative impacts.&#x20;

Starting the device only requires plugging in the USB drive, and flipping the switch to 'on'.

In the case of any issues, check the user guide for debugging options.

### Maintenance/Data Retrieval - two methods

Laptop

1. Turn off the device.&#x20;
2. Remove the USB drive and connect to the computer.
3. Download any data, upload a new schedule if desired (delete the old file).
4. Reconnect USB drive and power on device.

USB Drive Swap (second USB drive is needed)

1. Install new schedule to second USB drive before going to the field.
2. Turn off device, swap USB drives and power on again.
3. Take original USB drive to workstation for data retrieval.

When in the field, maintenance would include cleaning the solar panel of any debris that might have accumulated blocking the signal. If solar is not used, the battery may need to be charged which would require bringing it somewhere with ample power supply to charge, before returning it to the field.
