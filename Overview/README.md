# Report Overview

This report describes the work done by Tyler Schwenk and Frank Santana for The Nature Conservancy from June 2025 to December 31, 2025.

The objectives of this work were to "Refine the application of the previously developed _Rana draytonii_ BirdNET&#x20;machine learning model to reduce manual review effort of field recordings. This will be accomplished by iterating on the&#x20;existing model and by developing recommended default settings to achieve specific precision, recall and accuracy. The last&#x20;goal is focused on field testing an existing off the shelf real-time acoustic monitor for American Bullfrogs."

The documentation for the refinement of the _Rana draytonii_ machine learning model can be found under the "CRLF Model Refinement" tab.&#x20;

Documentation for the field testing of the ASU 2 real-time acoustic monitor, including usage guides, can be found under "ASU 2 Evaluation"
