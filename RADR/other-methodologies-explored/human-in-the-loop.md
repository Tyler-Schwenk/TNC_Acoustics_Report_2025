# Human In The Loop

Due to the nature of our source audio data, Human In The Loop (HITL) training was not necessary for my workflow. Our training data was already strongly labelled at the start of the contract to the lowest temporal granularity (3-second segments). For this reason standard training procedures were most effective.

For future work, HITL could improve the model efficiently as new 2025/2026 field season data becomes available, using model predictions to prioritize human review of uncertain cases rather than exhaustive manual labeling.
