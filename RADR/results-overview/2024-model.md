# 2024 Model

Below is the model tested on our new larger set of data curated for the 2025 model development season. This larger test set of data gave us improved insight into the performance of the previous model and allows a one-to-one comparison with our new models.

Key limitations include its poor generalization to new sets of data, and its reliance on recall at the cost of precision.
