# \[Archive] Stage 1 - Capacity & Regularization

#### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The Stage 1 sweep (capacity + regularization) was designed in a breadth-first style to identify which hyperparameter regions are promising for our custom BirdNET classifier. The results show some useful patterns, but also highlight high variability across runs.

**What Stage 1 Told Us**

* **Dropout**: 0.25 consistently improved out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization compared to 0.0 or 0.5.
* **Hidden Units**: Larger heads (1024 HU) gave the best _average_ performance, but smaller heads (128–512 HU) sometimes produced the single best OOD runs.
* **Learning Rate**: 1e-3 produced strong averages, but the _best individual OOD run_ came at 5e-4.
* **Batch Size**: 32 slightly outperformed 16, but was not a major factor.

In Retrospect: Stage 1 successfully established baseline hyperparameter regions but, as only a single seed was used per configuration, the results should be interpreted qualitatively. Subsequent multi-seed sweeps (Stages 2–4) confirmed that a variance floor of roughly ± 0.05 F1 exists, meaning Stage 1 differences smaller than this threshold likely reflected stochastic effects rather than true hyperparameter sensitivity.

#### Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

I ran a **72-config factorial sweep** to explore model capacity and regularization. **Factors varied:**

* Hidden Units: 0, 128, 512, 1024
* Dropout: 0.0, 0.25, 0.5
* Learning Rate: 1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3
* Batch Size: 16, 32

#### Base Configuration <a href="#base-configuration" id="base-configuration"></a>

**Dataset & Training**

* Dataset: High + medium quality positives, balanced negatives
* Epochs: 50
* Validation split: 0.2
* Negatives: included and balanced
* Seed: 123

**Inference & Evaluation**

* Thresholds: full sweep (0.0 → 1.0 step 0.05), baseline at 0.5
* Metrics: F1, precision, recall (IID and OOD splits)

**Fixed BirdNET Parameters**

* Frequency range: 0–15 kHz
* Overlap: 0.0
* Sensitivity: 1.0
* No augmentation: label smoothing, mixup, focal loss = off
* No upsampling (upsampling\_ratio=0.0)
