# Stage 7 - Focus on specific call type

In this experimental stage, I briefly explored the idea of training the model to identify specific types of the California red-legged frog's call, rather than both as the same label.&#x20;

This would take a significant amount of time to make a new experiment structure and testing dataset around each call type, and I consider it out of the scope of this current contract. It is an idea that could be explored in the future.

It should be noted that these models were evaluated on the same iid and ood testing data as all other models, there was no separation of call typed in the evaluation data.
